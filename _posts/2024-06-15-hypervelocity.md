### Abstract

Advancements in space exploration over the last few decades have led to a sharp increase in Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD), with the associated increased risk of hypervelocity impact on satellites and space structures. The Whipple shield can mitigate the effects of such impacts and current research is exploring further developments towards effective lightweight passive shielding technology to counter the damaging effects of MMOD. With the increase in MMOD and the prospect of increased space travel in the coming years and decades, it is vital that more research is conducted and improvements are made in the development and design of efficient, lightweight shielding technology to protect both unmanned and manned spacecraft against hypervelocity impacts (HVI). The optimisation of shield design for HVI is a high dimensionality problem, suited to advanced computational approaches. Key variables in HVI shield design that should inform the focus on optimisation include: impact velocity, rear wall thickness, projectile diameter and bumper thickness. A hybrid shield configuration and numerical model are proposed and validated, with alternating layers of aluminium (AL2024) and carbon fibre composites (CFRP, T300 woven-fabric) to form a 5 mm thick target plate consisting of 5 plies. The adaptive coupled FEM-SPH method is used to model the target plates. The proposed hypervelocity shield design optimisation methodology is based on Direct Simulation-based Genetic Algorithm (DSGA) optimisation and is implemented to optimise a multi-variable shield design space. Objective weightings are used to analyse and discuss results, referring to the ratio of the kinetic energy to the shield areal density objectives. A clear transition in the impact behaviour of the optimised MMOD shields is observed in the transition region from high-velocity to hypervelocity impact, where significant levels of kinetic energy dissipation are observed below the transition region, and lower energy dissipation at hypervelocity. The shield design optimisation results show that with a weighted kinetic energy to mass objective of 90:10, the kinetic energy of the back shield plate decreases significantly (62.7%) and the areal density can be reduced by more than 18%. Alternative configurations displayed sub-optimal results based on a trade-off between objective functions.
