### Abstract

Numerous studies have aimed to quantify and categorise the kinematics associated with sporting head impact to obtain a better understanding of the mechanisms of brain injury and observed increased risk of neurodegenerative disease resulting from contact sport participation [1-3]. To improve sensitivity of existing methods of head acceleration measurement in sport, such as mouthguards instrumented with inertial measurement units (IMUs), head impact exposure studies often utilise visual confirmation of head impact through video analysis: a heavily time-consuming and resource-intensive process [4]. In an attempt to overcome this issue, previous works have utilised deep learning computer vision algorithms to automatically detect the occurrence of head impact [5]. The present work introduces a fully automated, markerless approach for measuring angular head kinematics using computer vision techniques in an attempt to move towards a more efficient, non-invasive method for extraction of head kinematics.
